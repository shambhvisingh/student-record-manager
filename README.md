# 🎓 Student Record Management System

Hi! This is a simple Python project I made to practice working with databases. It's a student record manager that stores data using SQLite — like names, roll numbers, classes, and marks. You can add, view, update, or delete student details through a basic menu in the terminal.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm **Shambhvi Singh**, a Class 12 student learning Python and SQL. I'm exploring how databases work and how to build beginner-friendly projects using them.

This is one of my first real projects where I used what I learned about `sqlite3` in Python. I'm still learning, but I wanted to share this to show how I'm growing.

## 🧩 What This Project Does

- Add a student record (roll number, name, class, marks)
- View all records in the database
- Update marks for a student
- Delete a student record
- Saves everything in an `.sqlite` database file automatically

All of this runs in your terminal (CMD or shell), and the data stays even after you close the program.

## 🛠️ How to Use It

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download this file: `student_record.py`
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python student_record.py
A file called student.db will be created if it doesn't already exist.

📝 Notes
No external libraries needed — it just uses built-in sqlite3.

This is for learning purposes. I’m happy to improve it over time!

If you're new to Python and databases, feel free to explore or use this as a starting point.
